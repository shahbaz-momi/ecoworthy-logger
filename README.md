### Ecoworthy logger

Tired of your batteries connecting to arbitrary Chinese servers? Well look no further. This is a simple utility that connects via Bluetooth
to your Ecoworthy batteries and exposes them either via a simple command line log, or via Prometheus for use in Grafana, etc.

Bluetooth only for now; feel free to contribute CAN/RS485 support.

#### Tested batteries

- Ecoworthy 48V Server Rack Batteries - V3

#### Tested hardware

- Raspberry Pi Zero W

Anything that supports Bluetooth should theoretically work.
